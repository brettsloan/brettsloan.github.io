My personal projects to improve my skills as a developer<br>
Master Branch is sitting at V1.4 as of 08/29/2017<br><br>
<h1>RIFCO Info Hub</h1><br>
A place for RIFCO agents to view important information as well as day to day templates or other useful things.<br>
Master has known copy and paste issues with the RIFCO app.<br>
Use RIFCOApp-V1.1 or higher as they were fixed in that update.<br>
LOGIN Page of RIFCO app is useless as of now. Any username is accepted. No info or databases are used so nothing to worry about.
