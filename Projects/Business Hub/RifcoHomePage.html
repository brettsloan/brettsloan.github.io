          <h2>Frequency Change (FC):</h2>
          <p class="subP">
            The process of permanently changing the frequency of a
            payment schedule (biweekly, monthly, or semi-monthly payment schedule).
          </p>
          <h2>DDC Rules/Guidelines:</h2>
          <ul class="subL">
            <li>No administration fee is charged.</li>
            <li>
              The future requested payment date cannot go past
              the client’s next or previous amortized due date
              (the original schedule). In other words, the client cannot
              move their schedule more than a billing period ahead.

              In order to finalize the FC, the first payment
              on the new schedule must clear. If it does not,
              the administration fee will not be charged
              and the frequency of the account will revert back
              to its original status.

              The New Due Date must be greater than 10 BUSINESS days
