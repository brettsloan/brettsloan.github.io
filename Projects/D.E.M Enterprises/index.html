              We do this by working closely with the customer to layout the current or proposed systems and methods, the future manufacturing goals, and the equipment intended for use.<br><br>

              Using this data and the customers choice of software/CNC, we design engineer and implement a fully expanadble Lean Nested Based "System" for programing / cutting / machining and production.<br><br>



              Our purpose is to leave in place a "System" of Lean computerized manufacturing that can easily and efficiently be modified by the user, one that the user fully understands how to exploit for maximum benefit.<br><br>

              With any software and machine combination you have to get them working together to produce exactly what you want, and getting the software to do what you want is always the issue. Once you're there you need the ability get that code to your CNC as quickly and efficiently as possible - we show you how to do all that, from start to finish.<br><br><br>


              <b><i>*Off Site Programming</i></b><br><br>

            <p>April 2019,<br><br>
              With this new venture here's a bit about us,<br><br>
              Jim Demoraes<br>
              DEM Enterprises.<br><br>
            </p>
            <p>
              My Work Experience<br><br>
              I started training as cabinetmaker at Cassin Remco on Norfinch Dr in Toronto some 40 years ago and I've worked full time in the Canadian millwork industry since then.<br><br>
              I've made everything from production, reproduction and custom furniture, architectural millwork, store fixtures, displays, exhibits, custom stairs-doors-windows, to mahogany runabouts, stringed instruments, wheel cut glass, turning/milling/machining/welding stainless steel, all sorts of ornamental metal work and some jewelry.<br><br>
              I've worked with lumber solids, veneers and sheet stock of every description,
              laminates/plastics and acrylics/phenolics/celluloids/shagreen/bone and baleen, all sorts of glass, brass/aluminum/copper/stainless steel and precious metals.<br><br>
              I worked for a number of Toronto cabinet shops prior to starting a family woodworking business with a retail outlet on Eglinton Ave in 1983. This evolved into businesses with numerous specialties - from furniture into store fixtures, displays, exhibits through to architectural millwork of every description right into 2002.<br><br>
              Prior to retiring from full time work in April of this year, I spent the last 17 years general managing a Toronto millwork shop specializing in commercial / institutional millwork, and was I fortunate to have spent the last 7 + years working alongside my son Darren.<br><br>
              In my 40 years of working I've been directly involved both for myself and as a consultant, in the layout and setup of numerous woodworking manufacturing facilities, and multiple setups and integration of third party software with CNC machines.<br><br>
			        I sat on the AWMAC Ontario Board in 2009 - 2010 and I'm currently still AWMAC certified for work on GIS projects based on the latest North American AWS edition 3.1<br><br><br><br>

              My CNC and CAD Experience<br><br>

              My first exposure to CNC woodworking machinery was programming (right at the machine) and operating an SCM beam saw, and programing a Biesse pod and rail CNC with an AutoCad generated parts library and an add-on called SmartLister, in the late 80's.<br><br>
              At the time there was a lot of code editing done at the machine control to get everything just right, today the software is light years ahead. We're now multiple generations into third party software like Cabinet Vision and Mozaik that once fully exploited bring significant advantages to the user. <br><br>
              I've spent more than 17 years full time engineering projects and programing components, 10's of thousands of cabinets, displays and fixtures, and thousands of specialty item/components of in all sorts of materials.<br><br>
              I've been using Planit Solutions Cabnetware (since V5.0), Planit's Cabinet Vision (since V9.0) and Weeke's WoodWop (since V4.0), Mozaik (since v5.0), with AlphaCam and Autocad, I've also worked with Biesse, SCM and Thermwood's own software.<br><br>
              With this new business we plan to support integration using Microvellum in the near future.<br><br><br><br>


              About Darren Demoraes,<br><br>

              Darren started working with me in 2011 and he started that job at the beginning of the manufacturing process.<br><br>
              Over a few years he worked his way from shipping and minor drilling / secondary machining operations / helping on installations, to cabinet assembly and on to operating numerous machines including a standard and a cnc edgebander, then two years as full time CNC machininng centre operator.<br><br>
              Using a Lean Nested based manufacturing approach, in his time as a CNC operator Darren has cut thousands of sheets and organized for production thousands of components, and just as importantly he's dealt with the ever-present machine and software issues that can easily hinder production, and he's found the work-around each time.<br><br>
              Darren spent the last 2 years working alongside me in the office full time, he helped supervise the shop, he did most material and hardware purchasing, and he did all of the CNC programing of both cabinets and specialty components. He's already got thousands of sheets of programing and numerous software setup/integrations under his belt.<br><br>
              He's a Cabinet Vision power-user and he's fully trained and competent in the setup, use and integration of Cabinet Vision, Mozaik, WoodWop and Cabnetware, and soon to be in Microvellum.<br><br>
              Darren's studied first-hand the principals and processes behind Lean and effective manufacturing, he has first hand knowledge on the shop floor and experience with multiple third party software setups and CNC integrations, making him the ideal person to work with in this new business.<br><br><br>
