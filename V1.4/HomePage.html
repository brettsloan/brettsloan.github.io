          <p>
            Music has always been a huge part of my life. My grandfather was a jazz drummer, who started at a very young age. When he first came to Canada he immediately joined the musician's union as well as joining a big Jazz band, for which he composed most of the music they played.
          </p>

            My dad got my first drum set when I was 8 years old. From there I studied drumming under John Hughes at Georgina Music in Sutton Ontario. He continued to teach me at his house after he decided to leave Georgina Music. I took drum lessons for 6 years and still continue to play to this day.
          </p>

            I received my first guitar at 16 and took only a handful of lessons. I was old enough then to teach myself everything I know now. I've played guitar in multiple bands covering multiple genres. at 25 years old I still play drums and guitar every day, continue to learn new things, and better myself anyway I can.
