          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Music has always been a huge part of my life. My grandfather was a jazz drummer, who started at a very young age. He joined a big Jazz band, for which he composed most of the music they played.
          </p>
          <p>
            I got my first drum set when I was 8 years old. From there I studied drumming under John Hughes at Georgina Music in Sutton Ontario. I took drum lessons for 6 years and still continue to play to this day.
          </p>
          <p>
            I received my first guitar at 16 and took only a handful of lessons. I was old enough to teach myself everything I know now. I've played multiple instruments in many bands covering all sorts of genres. I still play drums and guitar every day, continue to learn new things, and better myself anyway that I can.
